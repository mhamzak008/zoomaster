Description:

Zoomaster is a standalone, desktop based application that allows a zoo keeper to manage different aspects of a zoo. For instance, using this application one can keep track of all the animals in the zoo such as their detailed info and their dietery habits. The application further gives a reminder to the zoo keeper to feed the appropriate animals at appropriate times. Zoomaster also keeps track of different nurseries around the zoo and reminds the zoo keeper to take appropriate actions, necessary for the nourishing of the plants in those nurseries.
